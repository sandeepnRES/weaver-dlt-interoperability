(You will need one service per channel.) Though such sharing can be implemented using several different mechanisms, ranging from manual to automated, the simplest and most modular way is to expose a REST endpoint that agents in foreign networks can reach. Further, this REST endpoint can be implemented as a standalone web application or it can be an extension of one or more of the existing Layer-2 applications.

Weaver will enable such a B/L to be fetched from a different network `trade-logistics-network` by querying the function `GetBillOfLading` exposed by the chaincode `shipmentcc` installed in the `tradelogisticschannel` channel.\n  \n  (In preparation, a suitable access control policy must be recorded on `tradelogisticschannel` in `trade-logistics-network`, and a suitable verification policy must be recorded on `tradefinancechannel` in `trade-finance-network`. We will see how to do this in the \"Startup and Boostrap\" section later.)\n  \n  You will need to insert some code in the Layer-2 application that accepts a B/L and submits a `RecordBillOfLading` transaction in `trade-finance-network`. (No code changes need to be made in any application in the other network.) The logic to accept a B/L should be replaced (or you can simply add an alternative) by a call to the `interopFlow` function offered by the [weaver-fabric-interop-sdk](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/weaver-dlt-interoperability/packages/888424) library (there's an [equivalent library in Golang](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/weaver-dlt-interoperability/releases/tag/sdks%2Ffabric%2Fgo-sdk%2Fv1.2.3-alpha.1) too). The following code sample illustrates this (the Golang equivalent is left to the reader):\n  ```javascript\n  const ihelper = require('@hyperledger-labs/weaver-fabric-interop-sdk').InteroperableHelper;\n  const interopcc = <handle-to-fabric-interop-chaincode>;   // Use Fabric SDK functions: (new Gateway()).getNetwork(...).getContract(<fabric-interop-chaincode-id>)\n  const keyCert = await ihelper.getKeyAndCertForRemoteRequestbyUserName(<wallet>, <user-id>);      // Read key and certificate for <user-id> from wallet (get handle using Fabric SDK Wallets API)\n  // Collect view addresses for relay requests in the context of an interop flow\n  interopJSONs.push({\n      NetworkID: 'trade-logistics-network',\n      RemoteEndpoint: <trade-logistics-relay-url[:<port>],      // Replace with remote network's relay address and port\n      ChannelID: 'tradelogisticschannel',\n      ChaincodeID: 'shipmentcc',\n      ChaincodeFunc: 'GetBillOfLading',\n      ccArgs: [ <shipment-reference> ],     // Replace <shipment-reference> with a value that can be used to look up the right B/L\n      Sign: true\n  });\n  const indices = [ 1 ];\n  // Trigger an end-to-end interoperation (data sharing) protocol\n  // Send a request to a foreign network via your relay, receive the response and submit a transaction to a local chaincode\n  const flowResponse = await ihelper.interopFlow(\n      interopcc,\n      'trade-finance-network',\n      {\n          channel: 'tradefinancechannel',\n          contractName: 'letterofcreditcc',\n          ccFunc: 'RecordBillOfLading',\n          ccArgs: [ <shipment-reference> , '' ]\n      },\n      <org-msp-id>,                         // Replace with this Layer-2 application's organization's MSP ID\n      <trade-finance-relay-url>[:<port>],   // Replace with local network's relay address and port\n      indices,\n      interopJSONs,\n      keyCert\n  );\n  // List of errors to check for\n  if (!flowResponse.views || flowResponse.views.length === 0 || !flowResponse.result || flowResponse.views.length !== argIndices.length) {\n      throw <error>;\n  }\n  ```\n  Let us understand this code snippet better. The structure in lines 156-161 specifies the local chaincode transaction that is to be triggered after remote data (view) has been requested and obtained via relays. The function `RecordBillOfLading` expects two arguments as specified in line 160: the first is the common shipment reference that is used by the letter of credit in `trade-finance-network` and the bill of lading in `trade-logistics-network`, and the second is the bill of lading contents. When the `interopFlow` function is called, this argument is left blank because it is supposed to be filled with contents obtained from a view request. The array list `indices`, which is passed as an argument to `interopFlow` therefore contains the index value `1` (line 150), indicating which argument ought to be substituted  with view data. The `interopJSONs` array correspondingly contains a list of view addresses that are to be supplied to the relay.\n\n  | Notes |\n  |:------|\n  | A local chaincode invocation may require multiple view requests to different networks, which is why `indices` and `interopJSONs` are arrays; they therefore must have the same lengths. |\n\n  The rest of the code ought to be self-explanatory. Values are hardcoded for explanation purposes, but you can refactor the above code by reading view addresses corresponding to chaincode invocations from a configuration file.\n\n  You also need to add the following dependency to the `dependencies` section of your application's `package.json` file:\n  ```json\n  \"@hyperledger-labs/weaver-fabric-interop-sdk\": \"latest\",\n  ```\n  (Or check out the [package website](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/weaver-dlt-interoperability/packages/888424) and select a different version.)\n\n  Before you run `npm install` to fetch the dependencies, make sure you create a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) with `read:packages` access in Github. Create an `.npmrc` file in the same folder as the `package.json` with the following contents:\n  ```\n  registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/hyperledger-labs\n  //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=<personal-access-token>\n  ```\n  Replace `<personal-access-token>` in this file with the token you created in Github.\n\n- #### Asset exchange:\n    - _Client Application_:\n        You need to first add the following dependency to the `dependencies` section of your layer-2 application's `package.json` file:\n        ```json\n        \"@hyperledger-labs/weaver-fabric-interop-sdk\": \"latest\",\n        ```\n        (Or check out the [package website](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/weaver-dlt-interoperability/packages/888424) and select a different version.)\n\n        Before you run `npm install` to fetch the dependencies, make sure you create a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) with `read:packages` access in Github.

To lock the non-fungible asset using hash `H` and timeout duration of 10 minutes, you need to add following code snippet in your application:\n        ```typescript\n        import { AssetManager, HashFunctions } from '@hyperledger-labs/weaver-fabric-interop-sdk'\n        \n        const hash = HashFunctions.SHA512();    // Create Hash instance of one of the supported Hash Algorithm\n        hash.setSerializedHashBase64(H);        // Set the Hash\n        const timeout = Math.floor(Date.now()/1000) + 10 * 60;\n        \n        const bondContract = <handle-to-fabric-application-chaincode-in-bond-network>;\n        \n        const result = await AssetManager.createHTLC(\n            bondContract,\n            \"Gold\",             // Asset ID\n            \"A123\",             // Asset Type\n            bobCertificate,     // Certificate of Bob in Bond Network\n            hash,                  // Hash generated by Alice using her secret s\n            timeout,            // Timeout in epoch for 10 mins from current time\n            null                // Optional callback function to be called after the asset is locked\n        );\n        let bondContractId = result.result; // Unique ID for this asset exchange contract in BondNetwork\n        ```\n        \n        Now `Bob` will lock his tokens in `TokenNetwork`. To lock the fungible asset using same hash `H` and timeout of 5 minutes (half the timeout duration used by Alice in `BondNetwork`), add following code snippet in your application:\n        ```typescript\n        const hash = HashFunctions.SHA512();    // Create Hash instance of one of the supported Hash Algorithm\n        hash.setSerializedHashBase64(H);        // Set the Hash\n        const timeout = Math.floor(Date.now()/1000) + 5 * 60;\n        \n        const tokenContract = <handle-to-fabric-application-chaincode-in-token-network>;\n        const result = await AssetManager.createFungibleHTLC(\n            tokenContract,\n            \"CBDC01\",               // Token ID\n            200,                    // Token Quantity\n            aliceCertificate,       // Certificate of Alice in Token Network\n            hash,                      // Hash H used by Alice in Bond Network\n            timeout,                // Timeout in epoch for 5 mins from current time\n            null                    // Optional callback function to be called after the asset is locked\n        )\n        const tokenContractId = result.result // Unique ID for this asset exchange contract in TokenNetwork\n        ```\n        \n        To query whether the assets are locked or not in any network, use following query function:\n        ```typescript\n        const contract = <handle-to-fabric-application-chaincode>;\n        // Below contractId is the ID obtained during lock\n        const isLocked = AssetManager.isAssetLockedInHTLCqueryUsingContractId(contract, contractId)\n        ```\n        \n        Now to claim the asset using the secret text (pre-image of hash) `s`, add following code snippet:\n        ```typescript\n        const hash = HashFunctions.SHA512();    // Create Hash instance of one of the supported Hash Algorithm\n        hash.setPreimage(s)                     // Set Pre-Image s\n        const contract = <handle-to-fabric-application-chaincode>;\n        const claimSuccess = await AssetManager.claimAssetInHTLCusingContractId(\n            contract,\n            contractId,                         // contractId obtained during lock\n            hash\n        )\n        // return value claimSuccess is boolean indicating success or failure of claim\n        ```\n        \n        If the asset has to be unlocked, use following code snippet:\n        ```typescript\n        const contract = <handle-to-fabric-application-chaincode>;\n        const reclaimSuccess = await AssetManager.reclaimAssetInHTLCusingContractId(\n            contract,\n            contractId                          // contractId obtained during lock\n        )\n        // return value reclaimSuccess is boolean indicating success or failure of reclaim\n        ```\n    \n    - _Application Chaincode_:\n        Application Chaincode can be developed in two ways, either use weaver `assetexchange` as library, or use interop chaincode to handle asset exchange by doing a chaincode to chaincode call.\n        - Use Library `AssetExchange`:\n            This method doesn't require `interop` chaincode to be installed. In you smart contract `go.mod`, add following in require (update the version according to the latest module version):\n            ```\n            require(\n                ...\n                github.com/hyperledger-labs/weaver-dlt-interoperability/common/protos-go v1.5.3\n                github.com/hyperledger-labs/weaver-dlt-interoperability/core/network/fabric-interop-cc/libs/assetexchange v1.5.3\n                ...\n            )\n            ```\n            Atleast following 5 functions needs to be added in chaincode (Note: the function signature, i.e. the name,  arguments and return values needs to be exactly same):\n            1. *LockAsset*\n            ```go\n            import (\n                ...\n                \"github.com/hyperledger-labs/weaver-dlt-interoperability/core/network/fabric-interop-cc/libs/assetexchange\"\n            )\n            func (s *SmartContract) LockAsset(ctx contractapi.TransactionContextInterface, assetExchangeAgreementSerializedProto64 string, lockInfoSerializedProto64 string) (string, error) {\n                // Add some safety checks before calling LockAsset from library\n                // Caller of this chaincode is supposed to be the Locker and the owner of the asset being locked.\n                contractId, err := assetexchange.LockAsset(ctx, \"\", assetExchangeAgreementSerializedProto64, lockInfoSerializedProto64)\n                if err != nil {\n                    return \"\", logThenErrorf(err.Error())\n                }\n                // Post proccessing of asset after LockAsset called like change status of the asset so that it can't be spent.\n                \n                return contractId, nil\n            }\n            ```\n            Here `assetExchangeAgreementSerializedProto64` is serialized protobuf in base64 encoded string of `AssetExchangeAgreement` protobuf structure, and can be used to extract details like asset id, type of asset and recipient.
